# Loofi Fedora Tweaks v5.0.0 - The "Visual Revolution" Update 🎨

Welcome to the future! We've ditched the old tabbed interface for a stunning, modern desktop experience.

## 🎨 Modern Dashboard & Sidebar

* **Sidebar Navigation**: A sleek left-side menu replaces the clutter of top tabs.
* **Dashboard**: Your new home screen! Check system health (Snapshots, Updates) and launch quick actions instantly.
* **Dark Glass Theme**: A custom `modern.qss` theme gives the app a premium, rounded look inspired by modern design languages.

## 🛡️ Safety & Recovery (Retained from v4.7)

* **Snapshot Check**: Still keeping you safe with Timeshift prompts.
* **Undo System**: Revert changes with one click.
* **Smart Locks**: Waiting for DNF locks gracefully.
