# Archived Screenshots (v32.0.0 and Earlier)

This directory contains legacy screenshots from older versions that are no longer referenced in documentation but are preserved for historical reference.

## Files

- `boot_tab.png` - Boot configuration tab (v32 or earlier)
- `dashboard.png` - Old dashboard view (superseded by `user-guide/home-dashboard.png`)
- `marketplace.png` - Old marketplace view (superseded by `user-guide/community-marketplace.png`)

## Why Archived

These screenshots were found in `docs/` root during the v41.0.0 screenshot update process:

1. Not referenced in any current documentation
2. Likely from v32.0.0 "Abyss" or earlier
3. Superseded by current screenshots in `docs/images/user-guide/`

## Restoration

If any of these screenshots are still needed:

1. Check if the tab/feature still exists in v41+
2. If yes, recapture with current UI
3. If no, document as removed feature
4. Move back to `docs/` or `docs/images/user-guide/` as appropriate

## Current Screenshots

- `docs/images/user-guide/` - Current user guide screenshots
- `docs/images/user-guide/README.md` - Screenshot catalog and guidelines
